                        &emsp; One of the key flaws in capitalism, and the modern political establishment, is the obsession many organizations have with profits and cash-flow. There has been an uptick recently in the idea that certain programs and services should make some sort of profit or at the very least sustain themselves monetarily. This method of thought can easily be seen in the rationale behind legalized trophy hunting. The thought processes many governments and organizations have been that conserved areas and environmental protection agencies should sell permits to violate their rules in a controlled manner to fund their own operations. While this does provide a significant income stream for these organizations and governments, it is not significant enough to justify legalizing the hunting of endangered species. Further, this focus on “sustainable” hunting of endangered animals draws in part from the aggressive commodification of Africa by western tourism companies. This push for Africa to be viewed as an exotic land to be explored often clashes with the realities of post-colonial development and economic reality. Due to this commodification, the hunting of African wildlife took on a significant amount of prestige and, because of that prestige, industry value. Now, however, hunting practices and ecological protection are based more on tourism and value extraction than the protection of ecological diversity.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Before we talk about hunting-based tourism, we first need to understand the larger picture of tourism in Africa and how the continent and people have been commodified and exploited for economic gain. Western tourists often hold the view that a vacation in Africa should focus on the “purity” of nature and local cultures.  This idea has led to the rise of voluntourism, or tourism-based volunteer work, and the increasing infantilization of local cultures used as attractions.  Safari companies often sell Africa as an untamed, yet safe, wilderness to explore and emphasize “traditionalism” of local cultures, a buzzword that exoticizes underdevelopment and poverty. 
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; This view of underdevelopment as some type of exotic experience would lead to the opening of a South African luxury hotel named Emoya Luxury Hotel which made headlines for its “unique accommodations”. This hotel, as CNN put it, was “something out of a Saturday Night Live sketch.” This hotel, named Emoya's Shanty Town, had guests stay in a re-creation of a slum, complete with shacks made of corrugated iron sheets. The hotel website advertised visitors would “experience staying in a Shanty within the safe environment of a private game reserve” for only $82 per night. Promising to deliver “the full African Experience” to guests, this hotel perfectly embodies the western view of rampant poverty in Africa as “exotic” and “cultural” instead of a result of the legacy of colonialism. This fascination with the “exotic” extends into the commodification of land, nature, and culture of African nations.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; This commodification of land and cultures can be seen again and again in advertised safari packages. The “Essential Kenya with Masai Mara” safari package is one such package sold by Kensington Tours.  A tour valued at $4,600 per person, over double the national average yearly income in Kenya, extolls “cultural immersion” and wildlife exploration. Naturally all while staying in hotels and resorts in stark contrast to the living conditions of the local communities. This company, owned and operated by a group of British and US nationals, extracts nearly four million dollars per year from these tours and safaris. This insane level of profit while operating in often destitute areas is not uncommon, the total African tourism market revenue is expected to top eighteen billion dollars by year end. In fact, this market makes up somewhere between 7-4.5% of Africa's GDP  with 63% of safari travelers coming from the USA (See Table 1.). In stark contrast to this booming economic market is the actual impact it has on the communities it showcases.

                        &emsp; Despite the massive percentage of GDP tourism encapsulates, local guides and communities often do not see even a sliver of some “rising economic tide”. Local tour guides are often heavily underpaid compared to western counterparts and safari operations often hire from outside sources for personal doing anything but menial labor. According to a company called AjKenyaSafaris, a business rated five stars on trip advisor, local guides can be hired for a cost of only $20, while professional guides run a price upwards of $200.  The average length of a guided tour is usually a full day, or eight hours, meaning that local guides are only paid $2.5 per hour for their knowledge and cultural connection to the land. Meanwhile professional guides, who have often gone to some type of school or program, are paid ten times the local rate. In addition to this, the facilities built in these communities are often far out of reach for any local customer. The Four Seasons resort inside Serengeti National Park, also located in one of the poorest regions of Tanzania, Mara, charges so much for even a main course that it would take a local resident eight days of labor to be able to pay for it. While in other countries, resorts and luxury hotels are at least somewhat accessible to the more affluent citizens, in Africa these operations almost exclusively cater to wealthy, often white, American and British tourists. The natural beauty of the land is enclosed in conservation areas and the local tribes and communities removed. Instead, the land is preserved for foreign tourists to experience and hunt indigenous species.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; This leads us to the topic of trophy hunting. Operating under a fee-based system, hunting laws have effectively rendered poaching legal, provided you pay a “fee”, or more accurately a fine, for felling specific animals. The draw of hunting a member of the “African Big Five” is often a key selling point of safari tours and, depending on if you kill enough, celebrated with trophies and awards from various hunting organizations. A congressional research inquiry into the topic of international trophy hunting in 2019 found that combination of poaching and high rates of trophy hunting have caused population declines in lions, leopards, and elephants.  These three species are all part of the big five, in fact, four of the big five members are protected by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) or Endangered Species Act, or both. Some studies have indicated that many African countries earn most of their trophy hunting revenue from the hunting of these five species.  The big five are not only endangered species, but highly profitable for the companies and countries allowing these hunting tours because of the high fees associated with them. (See Table 2.) Because of the fees associated with their hunting, there is a large financial incentive for government agencies to allow more hunting than is ecologically advisable.

                        <br>
                    <p>
                        &emsp; The economic benefit of these operations is often more beneficial to the organizers and government officials than the local populations. While some proponents of trophy hunting argue that the money generated helps communities in and around range areas by creating jobs, the actual percentage of revenue that goes to local communities is often disproportionally small. In one study , it was found that in Cameroon, less than 3% of revenue goes to local communities. In Zambia, communities received 12% of the revenue. Even in Tanzania with laws regulating a percentage of hunting revenue going to local communities, this funding is approximately 3%, even then it is allocated to “area and community development”, a vague statement which does not guarantee where exactly the funding went. Admittedly, some areas have a significantly higher percentage, such as Zambia’s ADMADE (Administrative Design for Game Management Areas) program that receives 67% of all trophy hunting revenue and directs 53% to local wildlife management. This wild discrepancy of fund allocation makes it clear that at the very least, transparency and openness is desperately needed when it comes to managing these hunting practices. While proponents of trophy hunting argue that it can be used as a conservation tool if managed correctly, we can see from the differences in funding (even within the same country) that this management is easier said than done.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Regardless of the economic impact, the ecological damage done to the genetic pools of endangered species cannot be disregarded. Trophy hunters often target specific traits in animals resulting in possible reductions in genetic pools and higher chances of inbreeding and low reproductive rates. Specifically in terms of the African lion, the removal of too many males from their population, which coincidentally are the most sought-after targets, would result in female lions in that pride being unable to mate. This drop in reproductive rates due to genetic issues compound the constant population drop hunting induces. While some countries have adopted regulations limiting hunting based on an animal’s age, this is not a blanket policy and reproductive rates of many species are below the population decline caused by both legal and illegal hunting. 
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Some studies have outlined some possible solutions to the problems inherent in trophy hunting.  Primarily, more research into the economic and ecological impacts of this practice is desperately needed. Informed policy decisions cannot be made without the appropriate level of scientific investigation. In addition, they outline how improved monitoring of wildlife populations would ensure that hunting quotas are sustainable and improved enforcement of existing legislation would reduce some problem areas. Specifically, they propose the idea of incentives for improved conservation performance by hunting operators such as some type of conservation certification. The issue with these solutions is that they all rely on the idea that the free market will agree with what is best for these conserved areas. Because this is such a highly profitable industry, poor regulation and even outright corruption could undermine any attempts to reign in trophy hunting. Once again, the idea that if we just have the right incentives, the market will align with society’s goals is proposed. This is why in many western nations, hunting of indigenous, endangered, animals is  outright illegal and not based on a fee system. Instead, companies and industry have outsourced the resulting ecological damage to Africa. This is consistent with how many other extraction-based industries operate in Africa, the resource (in this case animals) is extracted without care to the local environment and the profits are siphoned away out of that country into wealthy western nations. 
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp; Truly, the solution to protecting and preserving endangered species is a blanket ban on harming them or their natural habitats. Half-measures have thus far only delayed or slowed population growth, while our aim should be to reverse it. The slow decline of endangered animals will only cease with a strong reversal of current trends in hunting, poaching, and genetic diversity. We should be aiming to preserve the beauty and ecological diversity of Africa not so western hunters and tourists can visit and gawk at local natural parks and cultures, but so that future people of those cultures will have their heritage and cultural land preserved for themselves, something that the west has proven time and time again it does not care for.
