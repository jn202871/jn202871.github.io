        <strong>Node-Based Array With Random Gradient</strong>
    </a>
    <strong> April, 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &#167; Java program that creates a 2D array of variable width and heigh
    containing nodes that store a RGB value that changes gradually over the
    array.
</p>
<p>
    &#167; The purpose of this program was to give an example of how soft
    barriers could be implemented to a genetic algorithm. This would be used to
    encourage speciation by relating an agents RGB value to the environment to
    simulate "fit" for the current environment.
